# UNIX ASSIGNMENTS

## Assignment 1 UNIX Navigation

The following is by no means a full lesson in command-line navigation, but if you master these simple basics, I feel you will be able to get around and play in UNIX and Linux terminal environments with some confidence. Please, at first only type the commands listed here and nothing else. You will need to document your progress later. If you make mistakes that is ok, just retype and continue. Do not press enter repeatedly. This exercise should all fit on one terminal screen. After you’ve completed the assignment, practice until you have the commands memorized and down. Please be aware that I use the the term “folder” and “directory” interchangeably. The technical term in UNIX is “directory” but both terms mean the same thing.



Open terminal [if there is not a UNIX or Linux environment available there will be alternative instructions for replit]. At the CLI (**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface) prompt, type the following command and press enter. Please be aware that casing (capitalization) and spacing matter.

	pwd

This command prints your working, or “current” directory. This is your home directory. Now type 

	ls

This lists the contents of the folder or directory. In this folder, there should be a directory listed named “Documents.” To work in this directory, type the following command.

	cd Documents

You notice your prompt will now say Documents right before the prompt symbol [$, %, depending on version]. The command cd stands for “**c**hange **d**irectory.” To jump all the way back to your home folder (sometimes called “root”) from wherever you are, type

	cd ~

To jump back to the directory you were just in type

	cd -

You are now back in Documents. Let's make a new directory called “unix.”

	mkdir unix

Now let’s list our Documents directory to see that new directory.

	ls

We can make a new directory named “gawk” in that directory without being currently in that directory by typing in the name of the directory it resides in separated by ‘/‘ like so 

	mkdir unix/gawk

we can jump down to “gawk” by changing directories the same way.

	cd unix/gawk
Now, we can create a new blank text file in our directory [for replit the command will be gawk$ echo >”blank.txt” [enter] otherwise it will not show up in the ls listing]

	touch blank.txt

List your directory to see your new file.

	ls

Now let’s delete that file with the remove command.

	rm blank.txt

List our directory again to see if it is still there.

	ls

Now to go up one level in the file hierarchy, type

	cd ..

You are back in your “unix” directory. Now let's take a screenshot from our command line. [This will vary from version to version and OS to OS if running UNIX virtually. the command on macOSX is “screencapture” The following is the GNU/Linux version and also works on the windows command line as an alternative to setting up a nix environment on replit.] This screenshot you will turn in for your assignment so after the command “scrot” name your file with your last name  & first name Pascal cased, date, and followed with the word unix. All one word (LastFirstMMDDYYunix).  Do not forget to add .png to the end of the file name. [Turn-in instructions here]

	scrot GreenbergHank042522unix.png

You can open files from the command line too. Take a look at your screenshot. Here’s a shortcut. Press the up arrow a few times and watch your prompt. Did you see your command line history? Now arrow down until you see your last “scrot” command. Now arrow over so the cursor is just behind the ’t’ in “scrot” delete “scrot” and type 

	open GreenbergHank042522unix.png

Your image preview program should open and you can see your work. Now close that preview program and get back to your terminal. We do not need that directory named “gawk”. Let’s remove that with the remove directory command (NOTE: the following command only removes empty directories. Use rm -r ‘remove recursively’ option '-r' to remove a folder and all its contents, however, use this with extreme caution.)

	rmdir gawk

Now for our next lesson, we need a directory in our “unix” folder named “awk.”

	mkdir awk

Now one last command. If your terminal screen gets too crowded and you want to start with a fresh screen, type

	clear


## Assignment 2 Statistical Modeling 

You and your elbow-mate may choose one of four possible population data sets; Brooklyn's (BKLNpop.txt), New York City’s (NYCpop.txt), New York State’s (NYSpop.txt), or The United State’s populations from 1900 to 2020. You will write and run an awk program to predict the populations from your data set for 2030, 2040, and 2050 censuses. You will use the code from tedWarYears.txt as a guide. The data sets you are given are not separated by commas, so you will NOT need

	{FS = “,”}

AWK defaults to blank spaces as field separators. Another hint, remember when you use your ‘for’ loop to make your predictions at the end, is that you are not predicting consecutive years but stepping by 10s, so your update section cannot be i++. When you are done writing your awk script in a text file, you will run it from the command line with this format


	awk -f "filename.txt" inputfile.txt

There are only 3 fields in each data set, you will only need to use 2 to complete your assignment. Determine what is your x and y variable. Remember, it is the y variable you are trying to predict. The Linear regression Formula is 

	Y = a + bX

Answer the following questions. For credit, answer question 1. For an extra challenge, answer questions 2-4.
1. Using all available data points for your model (1900 - 2020) what does your model predict the population to be in 2030, 2040, and 2050?
2. Using all available data points for your model (1900 - 2010) what does your model predict the population to be in 2020? How much does your model differ from the real data? Can you calculate the percent difference? 
3. Using just the previous 4 data points (1990-2020) what does your model predict the population to be in 2030, 2040, and 2050? How much does this answer differ from the results you got in question 1? Can you calculate the percent difference? 
3. Using just the previous 4 data points (1980-2010) what does your model predict the population to be in 2000? How much does this answer differ from the results you got in question 2? Was it more accurate or less accurate? Can you calculate the percent difference?
